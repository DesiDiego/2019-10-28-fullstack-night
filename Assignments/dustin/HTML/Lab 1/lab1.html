                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        Garet Jax, better known as the Weapons Master, is a common figure of legend across the Four Lands.  His martial prowess is without equal.  Earliest stories speak of him being the lone survivor when his regiment was slaughtered to a man.  Later stories speak of a journey in which he protected and guided Jair Ohmsford to destroy the Illdatch where he finally met a mutual end with a legendary creature called a Jachyra.
