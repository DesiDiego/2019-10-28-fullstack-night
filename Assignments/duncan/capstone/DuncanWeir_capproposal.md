# MySpace 2003: 2
## Duncan Weir's Capstone Proposal

### Proposal:
My goal for the Capstone project is to create a working personal blog based on the design format for MySpace from when it initially launched in 2003. This page will utilize the Python framework Django to save and retrieve user information as well as to display a user's posts/feed.

### User Experience:
User's will be given a new and improved social media experience with a MySpace 2004 experienced improved for the needs of someone in the year 2020 user.
