    <pre>The Haunting of Hill House
    by Shirley Jackson


   
            No live organism can continue for long to
        exist sanely under conditions of absolute
        reality; even larks and katydids are supposed,
        by some, to dream.  Hill House, not sane,
        stood by itself against the hills, holding
        darkness within; it had stood so for eighty
        years and might stand for eighty more.  Within,
        walls continued upright, bricks met neatly,
        floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut;
        silence lay steady against the wood and stone
        of Hill House, and whatever walked there,
        walked alone.
