        <ul>
            <li>
                The time this guy accused me of stealing and using his towel in the sauna.  (I didn't.)
            </li>
            <li>
                The time this guy was shaving in the steam room and I could only tell because I heard the razor scraping.
            </li>
            <li>
                The time this guy listened to a news podcast full volume on his phone in the sauna and he annoyed me and ruined his speaker.
            </li>
            <li>
                The time this guy was using his phone in the hot tub and held it at such an angle that it wouldn't get wet AND it was pointing at everybody's junk and though he probably wasn't surreptitiously recording everybody it was still a really weak move and there's no reason you should bring your phone into the naked-ass part of the locker room.

                EXCEPT...
            </li>
            <li>
                The time this fully-clothed guy came into the sauna and said, "Do ya mind if I play some country music?" and even though it was the modern commercial stuff I don't care for I didn't mind because he asked and was super jovial about it and he didn't ruin his speaker.
